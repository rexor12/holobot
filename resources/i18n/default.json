Rules that apply to all channels are applied before those that apply to specific channels only.\n\nFor example, to allow the execution of commands in a single channel only, you would need two rules:\n1. :no_entry: Forbid the execution of all commands in every channel.\n2. :white_check_mark: Allow the execution of all commands in a specific channel."
